        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            If you feel the need for a little creative entertainment but also want it to be something you can do while taking 
            a quick break at work or in the bathroom, I want to provide a solution for you. Many people are familiar with the 
            old toy called a Lite-Bright. After buying and installing batteries, it allowed a person to place plastic pegs into a
            grid which enabled the pegs to light up in whatever design the user chose. Now, what if this was available as a 
            web app? I aim to offer such an experience with my Plumpin's Page app. It will be free to use and you can never lose 
            the parts or run out of the colors you love.<br> 
            The app will also provide a functional memory improvement page. This is a bonus and will be a good exercise for any 
            looking to sharpen their memory.

        <h3>Text Content</h3>
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Since the scope of my project extends past a simple site with text and images, I find it necessary to approach the assignment 
            in a slightly different way. The main content of the Home page with be animated links and descriptions to the other pages on 
            the site. Below this content, I plan to add a write up regarding the importance of play (see section below). The DotDaze page 
            will be an interactive way for the user to make their own art. Below that section I will add a write up regarding the benefits 
            of doodling (see section below). The MemoryMix page will be an interactive memory game. For this page I plan to add information 
            on the benefits of brain games (see section below). The contact page will be a basic page with little text content. 
        </p>
        <h4>The Importance of Play</h4>
        <p>
            https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/1/182
            “Play is so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the United Nations High Commission for Human 
            Rights as a right of every child.”
            <h5>Play is Essential</h5>
            “The overriding premise is that play (or some available free time in the case of older children and adolescents) is essential 
            to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and youth.”
            “Play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination, dexterity, and physical, cognitive, and 
            emotional strength. Play is important to healthy brain development.”
            “When play is allowed to be child driven, children practice decision-making skills, move at their own pace, discover their own 
            areas of interest, and ultimately engage fully in the passions they wish to pursue.”
            https://www.childrensmuseums.org/images/MCMResearchSummary.pdf
            <h5>Play and Learning</h5>
            In play, children develop a lasting disposition to learn. Having control over the course of one’s own learning, as in free 
            play, promotes desire, motivation, and mastery. Children also learn how to seek out knowledge; play involves exploration, 
            hypothesis testing, and discovery. What is more, all this is done in a safe, anxiety- and risk-free environment where children 
            are free to test the limits of their knowledge and abilities with relatively few repercussions. They learn to have confidence 
            in their ability to solve a problem, and they become resilient in the face of a challenge. Play builds the foundation for a 
            lifetime of learning. In play, children develop a lasting disposition to learn. Many of these skills, first developed through 
            play, are crucial for success in the 21st century. There is no doubt that amassing knowledge of the world around us continues 
            to be important in our society – and playful learning can help children to learn content-based lessons, too.

        <h4>Doodling for Stress Relief</h4>
        <p>
            https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-thinking-benefits-of-doodling-2016121510844
            <h5>Stress Reduction</h5>
            Spontaneous drawings may also relieve psychological distress, making it easier to attend to things. We like to make sense of 
            our lives by making up coherent stories, but sometimes there are gaps that cannot be filled, no matter how hard we try. 
            Doodles fill these gaps, possibly by activating the brain’s “time travel machine,” allowing it to find lost puzzle pieces of 
            memories, bringing them to the present, and making the picture of our lives more whole again. With this greater sense of self 
            and meaning, we may be able to feel more relaxed and concentrate more.
            <h5>Helps Concentration</h5>
            It seems then that if you’re struggling to concentrate, find yourself stuck or feeling “incomplete,” a time-limited doodle 
            expedition could be just the thing you are looking for. It will likely activate your brain’s “unfocus” circuits, give your 
            “focus” circuits a break, and allow you to more creatively and tirelessly solve a problem at hand.
            https://drexel.edu/goodwin/professional-studies-blog/overview/2017/June/Doodling/
            Creative Arts Therapy Department in the College of Nursing and Health Professions here at Drexel, recently conducted a study to 
            look at the biological effects of doodling. Their findings were recently published in The Arts in Psychotherapy. They found 
            doodling boosts blood flow in the frontal cortex of the brain. This effect enhances mood. In other words, doodlers experience 
            the psychological benefit of pleasure or well-being. Their study further found that 75% of those who participated in making art 
            (even those who are not terribly creative), reduced their cortisol levels, aka the stress hormone, in the brain.

        <h4>Benefits of Brain Games</h4>
        <p>
            https://sites.google.com/site/memoryproblems01/the-importance-of-memory-games
            <h5>The Brain at its Best</h5>
            Memory games are considered as one of the primary methods for ensuring that our brains are working at their best. These games 
            have become a subject of great interest to people because they are founded on sound science.
            Memory games are also very important for mental health and well being, neuroscientists have shown that regular brain fitness 
            training can provide considerable benefits to people with cognitive decline.
            The lesson here is that the earlier you begin engaging in Memory games aimed at exercising your brain the longer you will retain 
            your brain fitness. Therefore the importance of engaging in games aimed at testing and keeping your mind fit cannot be gainsaid 
            and it is beneficial for you to consider such games early on in life.
            https://socialworkprocesses.co.uk/3-benefits-playing-memory-games/
            <h5>Aging Well</h5>
            Memory loss is a natural process that all people may go through as we age and it may prove to be a little difficult to prevent 
            and it cannot be halted. However, it can be slowed down by properly exercising your brain and this can be done by playing memory 
            games. When you play these games and exercise your brain consistently, you will be able to avoid illnesses and diseases which are 
            memory-related. This is primarily because the brain is kept active often.
            When a person plays memory and brain-enhancing games regularly, he or she will not only be able to enhance the brain’s memory 
            function, but also other brain skills like concentration, focus, attention level, cognitive skills as well as reading and 
            reasoning skills. This is because many memory games are developed to allow the brain to think strategically and critically. 
            There are many memory games that have various levels of difficulties to holistically train and boost the brain.

        <h4>
            Heading Font: 'Architects Daughter'
        </h4>
        <p>
            Architects Daughter is fun and playful. It is hard to read in large sections but will be wonderful when used
            as headings. In some degree, a hamster could have written it. 
        </p>

        <h4>
            Paragraph Font: Roberto
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Roberto typeface is strong and clean, easy to read. It is a great contrast to the more playful heading font. 
            For these reasons, it seems great for the body text.
